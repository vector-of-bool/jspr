``jspr`` - JSON Processor
=========================

``jspr`` (or JSPR) (pronounced "jasper"), is a programming language whose AST
can be directly represented as a JSON document. ``jspr`` code can be written as
a JSON document, but can also be represented in other data formats such as YAML
and JSON5. Many aspects of ``jspr`` are designed specifically to appear
especially clean when written in YAML documents.
